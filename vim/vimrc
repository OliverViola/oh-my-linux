" Vim is based on Vi. Setting `nocompatible` switches from the default
" Vi-compatibility mode and enables useful Vim functionality. This
" configuration option turns out not to be necessary for the file named
" '~/.vimrc', because Vim automatically enters nocompatible mode if that file
" is present. But we're including it here just in case this config file is
" loaded some other way (e.g. saved as `foo`, and then Vim started with
" `vim -u foo`).

" This enables relative line numbering mode. With both number and
" relativenumber enabled, the current line shows the true line number, while
" all other lines (above and below) are numbered relative to the current line.
" This is useful because you can tell, at a glance, what count is needed to
" jump up or down to a particular line, by {count}k to go up or {count}j to go
" down.

" By default, Vim doesn't let you hide a buffer (i.e. have a buffer that isn't
" shown in any window) that has unsaved changes. This is to prevent you from "
" forgetting about unsaved changes and then quitting e.g. via `:qa!`. We find
" hidden buffers helpful enough to disable this protection. See `:help hidden`
" for more information on this.

" ========== 基础自定义 ==========
" 1. 把补全触发键从<C-Space>改为<C-n>（避免和终端/系统快捷键冲突）

" 2.禁用「输入小数点时自动弹出补全」，改为手动按<C-n>触发（避免频繁弹框干扰）

" 3. 强制jedi使用Python3（解决系统默认Python2的问题）

" ========== 补全/提示优化 ==========
" 4. 补全列表中显示函数/变量的类型（如def/var/class），更易识别

" 5. 缩小补全弹窗的宽度，避免占满屏幕
" let g:jedi#popup_max_width = 80
" 6. 禁用函数参数的自动提示（仅手动按K查看）

" ========== 跳转/搜索优化 ==========
" 7. 跳转到定义时，在新Tab页打开（不覆盖当前编辑窗口，推荐！）
